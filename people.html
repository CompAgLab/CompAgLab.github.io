              <p>
                My academic journey began at Sharif University of Technology
                (SUT), where I earned my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering. During
                my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in
                computational fluid dynamics (CFD), inspired by the intricate
                interplay between programming, mathematical modeling, and
                physical principles. This passion guided me to Northern Arizona
                University (NAU) for my M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, where I
                explored interdisciplinary research at the intersection of
                mechanics and biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                At NAU, I focused on cardiovascular and respiratory flow
                modeling, where I used advanced computational tools to uncover
                new insights into particle dynamics and mass transport. My work
                resulted in several high-impact publications and collaborations
                with leading institutions, igniting my enthusiasm for leveraging
                computational approaches to solve complex problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                I completed a Ph.D. at the University of Michigan under the
                guidance of Dr. Aaron Towne. My research lies at the
                intersection of fluid dynamics, modal analysis, and
                high-performance computing, with a particular focus on
                developing scalable algorithms for analyzing dynamical systems.
                I designed RSVD-Delta t, an efficient algorithm that computes
                resolvent modes with linear scalability, addressing key
                challenges in fluid flow modeling. This algorithm uses
                parallelized computing libraries (PETSc and SLEPc) and has been
                extended to perform harmonic resolvent analysis, enabling
                analysis of periodic flows. This work integrates mathematical
                rigor, algorithmic efficiency, and computational precision to
                address longstanding challenges in fluid dynamics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through my research, I have developed a deeper appreciation for
                the power of data-driven modeling, optimization, and statistical
                inference in uncovering patterns and solving real-world
                problems. My doctoral work has been guided by principles of
                optimization, from minimizing computational costs in large-scale
                simulations to leveraging data for model validation and
                enhancement. Additionally, my graduate coursework in machine
                learning, Bayesian modeling, and numerical methods has equipped
                me with a robust foundation for applying statistical tools and
                data-driven techniques to complex systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between computational
                mechanics and data science, contributing to both foundational
                research and practical applications. I am particularly excited
                about opportunities to explore interdisciplinary challenges
                where machine learning, optimization, and physics-based
                modeling converge, whether in fluid mechanics, biomechanics, or
                broader domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am now working on building Large Language Models for
                single-cell RNA expression prediction to help design better
                crops.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking forward, I aim to contribute to groundbreaking research
                that leverages advanced algorithms and data-driven insights to
                tackle critical scientific and engineering challenges.

                Juan Pablo Muñoz Díaz completed his Ph.D. under the supervision
                of Prof. Jesper Tegnér (KAUST), co-supervised by Dr. Narsis Kiani
                (Karolinska Institutet). His research merges machine learning
                and bifurcation theory to uncover hidden variables in nonlinear
                biological systems. He has conducted collaborative research at
                the University of Cambridge and presented at leading
                international conferences, including the International
                Conference on Systems Biology and the SIAM Conference on
                Dynamical Systems. He is now working on Mechanistic AI for
                modeling biological and crop growth, linking genes to
                intermediate and final phenotypes.
