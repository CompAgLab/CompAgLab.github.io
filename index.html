      <h1>Welcome to the Computational Agriculture Lab!</h1>
      <p>
        We explore how computation can advance agricultural questions and
        real-world impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple question guides the lab:
        <em>
          where can computation, modeling, and data accelerate discovery—and
          unlock the full potential of plant biology—to design crops for
          rapidly changing global conditions?
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are actively recruiting <strong>PhD students</strong> and
        <strong>postdocs</strong> with strong computational backgrounds to work
        at the intersection of AI (LLMs, mechanistic models, agentic systems),
        biology, and agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are located in the Crop and Soil Science Department in the College
        of Agriculture and Environmental Science at the University of Georgia.
